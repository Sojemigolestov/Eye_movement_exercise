# Eye movement exercise

# Project description

Mouse tracking eye movement created with HTML, CSS and JS, that renders two eyes on the center of the screen that follow the mouse movements and track it's position across the page.

# How to run

To run this project simply clone the repository and either double-click the index.html file or drag it onto your browser. Allways make sure all the files are within the same directory otherwise there might be unexpected issues!

# Roadmap of future improvements

In future iterations of this project I'll implement blinking and an idle mode that causes the eyes to close as if the page just goes to sleep if no movement is detected.
